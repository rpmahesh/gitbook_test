However, unlike Uttapam is little thicker and is topped with different types of veggies like onion, tomato, capsicum, carrot, green chilli, sweet corn etc. which makes it even more healthier and tastier.

## **Ingredients:**

| 2 cups Idli or Dosa batter |
| :--- |


| 1 medium Onion, finely chopped \(approx. 1/2 cup\) |
| :--- |
| 1/2 cup finely chopped Capsicum, optional |
| 1/3 cup finely chopped Tomato |
| 2-3 green chillies, finely chopped |
| Oil for shallow frying |
| Salt to taste |

## Directions:

1. Buy the readymade batter from the grocery store. Add salt \(if not added before fermenting the batter\) and water \(if needed\) in batter; mix well. Batter should be slightly thicker than dosa batter and slightly thinner than idli batter.

2. Heat cast iron tava \(dosa tawa\) or non-stick tawa over medium flame. \(for nice golden color, we recommend to use cast iron tawa.\) Add few drops of oil on hot tawa and spread it using a halved potato or a halved small onion. This process helps spreading of batter and also prevents it from sticking. Repeat this process before making each uttapam.

3. When tawa is ready, pour one laddle batter and spread it in round shape by gently rotating the ladle in clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. make sure that batter spread is slightly thicker than a batter spread for Dosa.

4. Sprinkle 1-2 tablespoons finely chopped onion and 1-2 tablespoons finely chopped capsicum over it.

5. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon finely chopped tomato and finely chopped green chillies over it. Gently press the veggies with a spatula.

6. Drizzle 1-teaspoon oil around the edge.

7. Cook for about 2 to 3 minutes with the lid closed.

8. Flip the dosa with a spatula and cook for 1 minute.

9. Enjoy with chutney.
